# Final-Project (Convolution)
December 2, 2021, Final Project (Game Jam) for MSCH-C220
Members: Kaitlin Harris, Grace Richardson, Avriel Donaldson

## Theme
We interpretted the theme as making literal poison. The poison that you are injected with at the end makes you forget everything and resets the day.

## Game Play
A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game in Godot. Includes multiple locations and different choices. Convolution is another word for loop or coil. The main theme of the game is being stuck in a loop. There's not necessarily a way to win because the player will keep getting poisioned and will keep forgetting their memory as the day restarts. 

## Impediments
 Members didn't feel like coding was their strong suit... so we made the best out of the strengths that we had. 

## Implementation
